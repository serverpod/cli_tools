# CLI Tools

This package contains tools for building great command line interfaces.
These tools were developed for the Serverpod CLI but can be used in any Dart project.

## Config library

The `config` library has been moved into its own package, published on pub.dev as [config](https://pub.dev/packages/config).

## Command line completion

`BetterCommandRunner` has support for command-line completion, which is currently
an experimental feature and requires installing an additional tool. See:
[README_completion.md](README_completion.md)
